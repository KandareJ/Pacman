# Pacman

Pacman is an open source game I made for fun to practice certain design patterns and algorithms that I learned about in school on a real project.

## Setup

Allegro 5
g++ *.cpp -o PACMAN -lallegro -lallegro_main -lallegro_primitives -lallegro_color -lallegro_font -lallegro_ttf -lallegro_image
