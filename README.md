# Pacman
Pacman is a multiplayer, battle royale style pacman game written in c++ and using Allegro 5.

## Setup
To run Pacman, you need to have Allegro 5 installed. Either download one of the binaries for your operating system [here](https://liballeg.org/), or build it yourself from this [repo](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5).

Run the command `make` to compile Pacman.

## Levels
Pacman levels are loaded in dynammically from the levels directory. For now, there is no level builder, but I plan on implementing one in the future. Levels can be built manually in any text editor
